**Biography**

I got my M.S. degree in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and I my B.Eng. degree from School of Data and Computer Science, [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm)(SYSU).



I am both Hakka(客家人) and Teochew people(潮汕人) (Grandfather from Shantou). Here are my [resume](https://github.com/SnailWalkerYC/SnailWalkerYC.github.io/blob/master/SDE_AI_YuChen.pdf), [Github](https://github.com/SnailWalkerYC) and [LinedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-chen-aa6404b8/). By the way, I like writing technology blogs and ranked top 900 in CSDN (CSDN has more than one million Chinese software engineers) with nickname [Snaile_Walker](https://blog.csdn.net/c602273091). In another community Zhihu, I have more than 1000 fans, see [here](https://www.zhihu.com/people/SW-Nothing/activities) for more details.  



**Work Experience**

- I am a senior software engineer(perception) in an autonomous driving company in Bay Area. My job is more relative to the sensor fusion tracking with LiDAR, cameras and radar. For the sensor parts, I am familiar with these sensors (multiple cameras, multiple radars & LiDARs) and wrote drivers to fetch with specific requirements and pre-processing these data. For the fusion part, I am trying to fuse different sensors' data to get better tracking objects' direction and velocity.

- I used to be a software engineer(AI) in a startup named [Black Sesame Technologies, Inc](http://bst.ai/)(raised more than $100M, I am former 30 employees in US office). My previous mentor is [Guan Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-ErxbcAAAAJ&hl=en). I used to focusing on 3D computer vision including 3D cross-modal visual localization, depth estimation, pose estimation, etc. You can see my recently deep localization paper from [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07160) and applied 3 US patents.

- I used to intern in [Machine Intelligence Lab, Alibaba](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/?goto=1) with mentor [Dr. Zhenyu Gu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhenyu-gu-9120555) and [Dr. Luo Si](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/lsi/). The intern project is about CNN acceleration and optimization on FPGA. I rewrote the C++ verions ResNet to be suitable, reuseble and modularity in Xilinx FPGA platform. Comparing to general CPU, there is about 5x speedup and 10x power saving. Besides, I had intern experience in Rockchip as a research engineer in error concealment in video decoding. My conclusion paper can be found [here](https://github.com/SnailWalkerYC/SnailWalkerYC.github.io/blob/master/An%20Efficient%20Error%20Concealment%20for%20Whole%20Frame%20Loss%20with%20Violent%20Motion.pdf). I designed and implemented the whole pipeline and got state-of-art visual quality, PSNR and SSIM. During my bachlor degree, I used to be a teaching assistant in discret mathematics, digital circuit design, signal processing and communication principal. 



I like joining different competitions including programing competitions, hardware competitions, robot competitions and even creative competitions.
