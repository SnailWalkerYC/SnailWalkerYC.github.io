### Forward & Backward Propagation



###  Component





### Unbalance Label

-  Re-sampling: over sampling on small size label
- Synthetic Samplings: add Gaussian noise into this data; interpolation. **SMOTE**
- Re-weighting: according to the inverse label size
- Transfer leaning: large sampling to train the network, small network, use the large sampling model to teach the samll network
- **metric learning** 
- Decoupling of representation & classifier.
