In visual SLAM, depending on the camera types, we can divide vSLAM into mono-SLAM, stereo-SLAM and RGBD-SLAM. Different sensors have theis limitation. For instance, mono-camera will suffer from nont-scale and scale shift problem. stereo camera will suffer from high computation cost on matching and calibration accuracy problem. RGBD cameras like RealSense can run well in indoor scenarios, but in the outdoor environment, the distance measurement will suffer from light affection of the camera signal receiver. To recover the absolute scale of the camera poses, the IMU can be added into the mono-SLAM system, but there is one requirement for the excellent synchronization of IMU and camera time stamps. So the price of mono-IMU is rather expensive.

In this poster, I would like to talk more about mono-SLAM and some traditional SLAM methods: DSO, ORB and LSD.
